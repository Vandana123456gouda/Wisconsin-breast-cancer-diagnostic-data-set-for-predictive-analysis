# Wisconsin-breast-cancer-diagnostic-data-set-for-predictive-analysis
Using the Wisconsin breast cancer diagnostic data set for predictive analysis Attribute Information:  1) ID number  2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) -3-32.Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:  a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)  b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)  c) perimeter  d) area  e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)  f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)  g). concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)  h). concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)  i). symmetry  j). fractal dimension (&amp;quot;coastline approximation&amp;quot; - 1) The mean, standard error and &amp;quot;worst&amp;quot; or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.  So the analysis and prediction will be based on Pyspark and matplotlib and seaborn you can use 1) Load Libraries 2) Load the data using pyspark only 3) Clean and prepare data 4) Explore data: in this find out different visulization using seaborn and matplotlib to explore more and understand correlation for furthure analysis like  5) Creating a test set and a training set 6) Logistic Regression model for prediction (mlib)
